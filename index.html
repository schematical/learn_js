<p>This miricul of modern scinence can be acomplished with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>. The bulk of learning resources for learning NodeJS can be found on their <a href="http://nodejs.org/community/">community page</a>. There is also an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js">amazing thread on Stack Overflow</a> that covers this.</p>

<p>NodeJS is not just a web server. It is much much more. It can be easily used to script any programmatic tasks. Lots of major frameworks are using it to build command line utilities that assist their programs build primarily in other languages.</p>

<a name="mobile-apps" class="anchor" href="#mobile-apps"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mobile Apps:</h3>

<p>If you want to build a mobile app with out needing to learn Java, Objective C, and whatever windows and Blackberry are written in then you will want to check out <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>. Apple still makes publishing an app to their market place as much fun as sticking nails in your eyes, and Android still requires you to install the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android SDK</a> (Peace of cake). Overall its still a lot easier than learning all of the different languages. </p>

<p>NOTE: This is not saying that it is not beneficial to eventually learn the other languages. Remember my goal is to get you the ability to learn 80% of the benefit with 20% of the time spent to learn any one other language.</p>
